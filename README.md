# Doubleday OS

Doubleday OS is the product platform for Doubleday Expressions: a compliance and management-systems operating system for ISO consultants and their clients.

The repository currently contains the public marketing website at its root. The target OS architecture, domain model, and phased delivery scope are documented in [`docs/`](docs/). The public site will migrate into `apps/website` as part of a deliberate Next.js migration; it remains at the root today to avoid disrupting the existing deployable application.
